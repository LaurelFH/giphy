//GENERAL LOGIC PLAN 

//USER-SIDE  
/*
1.  user arrives to the page that has a set of buttons already visible with animal names (to start as a cue? or maybe appended?)
2.  user clicks a button with one of the animal names on it 
3.  when clicked, the button calls up 10 gifs which contain the named animal (from the button)
4.  These 10 gifs from gif's database are visible after the button is clicked
5. the user can add more buttons by using the "submit" button and a new animal button is created next to the others 




//COMPUTER-SIDE (ajax call other notes from readme!)

1.contain some present cue buttons? when the page is loaded
2.when the user clicks a pre-set button, then the animal on the button value should be pulled from API
3. 10 gifs of this animal button's value need to be displayed
4. the button remains on the page (not refreshed?)
5. if the user uses the submit/input box to add another animal name, then a new button should be created, with the value from that input box
6.the button, the gifs from that value and the animal gifs should be made visible
